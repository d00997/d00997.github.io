          <h3>Selfie</h3>
          <p>Create a self-portrait in black and white. Use this as an opportunity to teach the rest of the class something interesting and unique about yourself. Avoid simple facts, or any information about you that others may already know. This is a rare opportunity to make a completely considered first impression; don't waste it.</p><a class="button" href="selfie.html">MORE</a>

            <h3>it's the thought that counts</h3>
            <p>A good designer should be an excellent gift-giver. Give a gift to someone in your life. This gift must not be for an occasion or otherwise expected. Document your process, the gift itself, and (if non-intrusive) the delivery of and response to the gift.</p><a class="button" href="it's_the_thought_that_counts.html">MORE</a>

          <h3>The Pen is Mightier</h3>
          <p>Prepare a written critique of one aspect of The New Yorker, given their recent design refresh. Focus on either the print edition, the website, the iOS newsletter app, or some other facet of the brand. We will use everyone's written piece as a jumping off point for an in class critique. It is more important that your criticism be thoughtful and enlightening than your writing be exceptionally creative or high quality. Refer to the provided guidelines when writing your criticism.</p><a class="button" href="the_pen_is_mightier.html">MORE</a>

          <h3>Nemesis</h3>
          <p>Create a brand that is in direct competition with a prominent, existing company. Carefully choose a company and a market that you have some knowledge or experience with, or that is badly in need of a new voice. Think about the practical considerations of your brand and realize that what will set your ficticious company apart will not be simply color, typography, or a logo. Be bold and indulgent. Design the kind of company you want to exist in the world. The "well designed version of X" is not an acceptable competitive edge, nor is painting colorful shapes or lines on existing products. Try harder.</p><a class="button" href="nemesis.html">MORE</a>

            <h3>Become the Master</h3>
            <p>Use your design skills to teach something you're specially qualified to teach. Your goal should be for everyone that views your work to learn something new and retain this knowledge. Focus on something simple but unique, such as the unique way you fold your shirts, or the most effective way to cut an onion. The viewer should feel good if they are able to learn something from your project.</p><a class="button" href="become the master.html">MORE</a>

          <h3>Monograph</h3>
          <p>Share something you have special knowledge or expertise on in a concise way. The format can be a publication, book, website, or something else, as long as it has a clear beginning and end. You are reponsible for authoring, creating, collecting, or curating all of the content in the monograph.</p><a class="button" href="Monograph.html">MORE</a>
